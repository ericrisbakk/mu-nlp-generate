Two approaches:
N-gram model combined with bag of words.
LSTM (has an error)

Approach 1:
generates a dictionairy for combination of words and counts how often they occur for each n-gram up to the maximum inputted size.

example of the generated text using only the first 6 songs:

'was please lucky wanna wanna she you'll lucky smile Who show a here time, tired kind your Andante something your slowly learn packing surrender be Well, Like do? walking found sweet thought Look dumb I Dum-be-dum-dum Touch Burning feels Well, Yes, I rotten question hours walkin' walkin' ma learn She's Holy Saying to think it's used sweet enough little time she ever play entitled things grow here You end you've be-dumb-be-dumb-dumb believe please - (You at means No fine face, sing, blue Andante Girl Once cutting Oh kind of out throwing together use Look away Being warm.'

2 experiments:
- how does the n-gram size inpact the results?
- does cleaning the text generate better texts?

these answers are based on a scoring metric provided by textatistic.

## Example songs generated by the RNN

Possibly because of a training error, the RNN seems obsessed with ABBA's andante.
Below are a couple of example songs:

- seed: "End of passion play, crumbling away I'm your source"
- song: "end of passion play crumbling away i m your source in \\n \\n andante one \\n andante \\n \\n andante andante she s just you make girl i andante i m your \\n and \\n and \\n music and me \\n \\n i m am your song \\n i am your song \\n i am your music what could i \\n i and i am your music \\n and and i am your song your time and your \\n \\n and she could she she smiles she i m that she sees \\n \\n \\n \\n i m your i that she could s just my soul andante andante andante"


- seed: "He sleeps under black seas waiting, Lies dreaming in death"
- song: "he sleeps under black seas waiting lies dreaming in death \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n plan i it means \\n i am your song \\n i m your song \\n i am your music and i am your song \\n and leaves me time \\n who could ever believe that she could be \\n she could be \\n she sees me \\n she s just my kind of girl without me makes me and me and she i am your song i m your music and i and i what i am your i leaves \\n i do who could could i \\n \\n she s just my kind"


- seed "I am a man who walks alone, And when I"
- song: "i am a man who walks alone and when i fellow \\n she s just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine \\n who could ever could ever mine \\n who could ever believe that she could ever she s just my kind my kind of i could i \\n \\n \\n i \\n me \\n a i time \\n \\n \\n \\n and \\n and let \\n i believe that she could she s she sees me \\n my just me \\n we plan \\n she s just my kind of girl without me makes me \\n \\n i what could i do \\n who could ever"
